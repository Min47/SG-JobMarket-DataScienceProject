# Cloud source ignore rules
#
# This file is used by `gcloud` for commands like `gcloud builds submit`.
# It must NOT exclude Dockerfiles, Cloud Build configs, or source folders needed
# to build Cloud Run Jobs (e.g., JobStreet/MCF scrapers, embeddings).
#
# Keep this focused on large/local-only artifacts.
