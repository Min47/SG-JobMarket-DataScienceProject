## ✔️ Delegation Plan (End-to-End)

This document splits the platform into agent-owned workstreams and defines contracts (schemas, interfaces, handoffs) so implementation can proceed without ambiguity.

## 0. Pipeline Contract (Single Source of Truth)

Target pipeline:

Cloud Scheduler → Cloud Run (Docker: scraper runner) → GCS (raw JSONL) → ETL job → GCS (processed Parquet) → BigQuery (raw_jobs, cleaned_jobs, embeddings, features) → Vertex AI (training/evaluation) → Cloud Run (FastAPI) → Looker Studio / Streamlit.

Non-negotiables:
- All code reads config from env (`.env` locally) via `utils.config.Settings`.
- All external calls must use retry (`utils.retry`) + logging (`utils.logging`).
- Scraper output must match the `raw_jobs` schema contract.

## 1. Workstream Split (Agents, Deliverables)

### A. Project Lead Agent
Deliverables:
- Folder structure compliance (as in README.md).
- Schema contract definitions and module boundaries.
- PR checklist + acceptance criteria for each workstream.
- Integration guidance: how components connect and what each produces/consumes.

Done criteria:
- Every folder contains at least one base file and docstrings.
- `utils/` exposes stable interfaces for config/logging/retry/schemas.

### B. Scraper Engineer Agent ✅ COMPLETED
Scope:
- Implement `scraper.base.BaseScraper` concrete scrapers for:
  - JobStreet
  - MyCareersFuture
- Strategy: GraphQL APIs (preferred) or Selenium (headless).
- Produce JSONL lines aligned to `utils.schemas.RawJob` fields.

Deliverables:
- ✅ `scraper/jobstreet.py`, `scraper/mcf.py` implemented.
- ✅ Deterministic JSONL writer (local + GCS upload with compression).
- ✅ Smoke script to run a small crawl and write `data/raw/.../dump.jsonl`.

Acceptance criteria:
- ✅ Each record contains: `title, company, location, description, date_posted, url, source, salary_text`.
- ✅ Records validate against `raw_jobs` BigQuery schema (`utils.bq_schemas.raw_jobs_schema`).

**Implementation Details (Completed):**
- **JobStreet:** Two-phase strategy using v5 listing API + GraphQL detail queries
  - Phase 1: Collect job IDs from paginated listing API with incremental checkpointing
  - Phase 2: Batch GraphQL queries (max 32 per batch) for full job details
  - Progressive rate limiting: 10min → 30min → 1hr → abort (cumulative tracking)
  - Robust error handling: individual job failures don't break batches
  - GraphQL fragment in `scraper/jobstreet_queries.py`
- **MyCareersFuture:** Selenium + API hybrid
  - Phase 1: Selenium WebDriver collects job UUIDs from dynamic search pages
  - Phase 2: REST API calls for detailed job information
- **Base Infrastructure:**
  - `scraper/base.py`: Abstract base class with retry logic, user-agent rotation, session management
  - GCS upload support: `GCS_UPLOAD_ENABLED=true` in environment
  - 30-day local retention policy: `LOCAL_RETENTION_DAYS=30`
  - `scraper/validation.py`: JSONL validation utilities
  - `scraper/smoke_test.py`: Quick local testing script
- **Entry Points:**
  - `python -m scraper --site jobstreet`
  - `python -m scraper --site mcf`
  - `python scraper/smoke_test.py jobstreet`
- **Cloud Deployment:**
  - Docker images: `Dockerfile.scraper.jobstreet`, `Dockerfile.scraper.mcf`
  - Cloud Build: `cloudbuild.jobstreet.yaml`, `cloudbuild.mcf.yaml`
  - Artifact Registry: Images pushed and ready
  - Cloud Run Jobs: Created and configured

### C. Cloud Backend Agent 🔄 70% COMPLETE
Scope:
- Cloud Run packaging, scheduler trigger contract, storage and BigQuery helpers.

Deliverables:
- ✅ Dockerfile(s) for:
  - ✅ scraper runner (JobStreet, MCF)
  - 🔲 API service (pending API Engineer implementation)
1. ✅ Scaffolding: create mandatory folders + base contracts.
2. ✅ Backend Agent: implement GCS helpers + dockerization + deployment scripts.
3. ✅ Scraper Agent: implement scrapers end-to-end and write raw JSONL locally + GCS.
4. ✅ Cloud Backend Agent: wire raw JSONL upload to GCS path contract.
5. 🔄 ETL Agent: implement transform + streaming + load to BigQuery.
6. 🔲 ML Agent: add embeddings + baseline models + artifact persistence.
7. 🔲 API Agent: implement endpoints backed by BigQuery and models.
8. 🔲 Dashboard Agent: build Streamlit dashboards and/or Looker Studio config.

Development Rules:
- ✅ **Base Infrastructure:** Config, logging, retry, schemas complete
- 🔲 **BigQuery:** Stub only, needs `stream_rows_to_bq()`, `ensure_dataset()`, `ensure_table()`
- 🔲 **Cloud Scheduler:** Not configured yet (Phase 5)
- 🔲 **Deployment Scripts:** Need automation scripts in `deployment/`

**Next Priority:** Implement BigQuery streaming API to unblock ETL Cloud Function

### D. ETL Engineer Agent 🔲 NOT STARTED (BLOCKED)
**Status:** Waiting for BigQuery streaming API from Cloud Backend Agent

Scope:
- Normalize/clean raw records and create `CleanedJob` outputs.
- Dedup by stable hash (title+company+description_clean).
- Stream cleaned data directly to BigQuery (no intermediate Parquet - cost optimization).
- Deploy as Cloud Function with GCS finalize trigger.
- Note: Embeddings are handled by ML Agent.

Deliverables:
- 🔲 Implement `etl/cloud_function_main.py` (Cloud Function entry point)
- 🔲 Implement `etl/pipeline.py` plus supporting modules
- 🔲 Robust salary parser in `etl/salary_parser.py`

- 🔲 Deterministic job_id generation.
- 🔲 Event-driven: Automatically triggered when scraper uploads to GCS
- 🔲 Idempotent: Can reprocess same file safely

**Blocker:** Cloud Backend must implement `utils/bq.py` BigQuery streaming API first

### E. ML Engineer Agent
Scope:
- Embeddings, features, training/evaluation.

Deliverables:
- Implement `nlp/embeddings.py` (choose model + dependency strategy).
- Implement `ml/train.py` and evaluation outputs.
- Persist artifacts to `/models` and optionally to GCS.

Acceptance criteria:
- Produces embeddings table and/or files with stable IDs aligned to `job_id`.

### F. API Engineer Agent
Scope:
- FastAPI service deployed to Cloud Run.

Deliverables:
- Implement `api/app.py` with endpoints:
  - `/predict-salary`
  - `/similar-jobs`
  - `/embedding`
  - `/cluster-insights`
- Request/response schemas (likely Pydantic).

Acceptance criteria:
- No hard-coded project IDs.
- Uses BigQuery for reads; models loaded from GCS/local image.

### G. Dashboard Engineer Agent
Scope:
- Streamlit dashboards and/or Looker Studio guidance.

Deliverables:
- Implement `dashboard/app.py` and pages per README.

Acceptance criteria:
- Reads from BigQuery dataset only.

## 2. Integration Handoffs (Contracts)

### Scraper → GCS (raw)
- Format: JSONL
- Naming: `raw/{site}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/dump.jsonl`
- Record contract: `utils.schemas.RawJob`

### ETL → GCS (processed)
- Format: Parquet
- Naming: `processed/{date}/clean.parquet`
- Record contract: `utils.schemas.CleanedJob`

### ETL → BigQuery
- Tables:
  - `raw_jobs` (append)
  - `cleaned_jobs` (merge/upsert by `job_id` or append + dedupe logic)

### NLP/ML → BigQuery + Models
- `embeddings` table: `job_id` + vector
- `features` table: engineered features per `job_id`
- `/models` artifacts and mirrored in GCS.

## 3. Execution Steps (Lifecycle Initiation)

1. Scaffolding (done in this commit): create mandatory folders + base contracts.
2. Backend Agent: implement GCS helpers + dockerization + deployment scripts.
3. Scraper Agent: implement 1 scraper end-to-end and write raw JSONL locally.
4. Cloud Backend Agent: wire raw JSONL upload to GCS path contract.
5. ETL Agent: implement transform + Parquet + load to BigQuery.
6. ML Agent: add embeddings + baseline models + artifact persistence.
7. API Agent: implement endpoints backed by BigQuery and models.
8. Dashboard Agent: build Streamlit dashboards and/or Looker Studio config.
